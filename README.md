This code manages and displays patient appointments using a combination of file handling, a dictionary, and a graphical user interface (GUI) created with tkinter. 
The code reads a list of scheduled patients from an external text file and stores predefined patient appointments in a dictionary. 
The user can input a patient's name, and the script checks if the patient is already in the dictionary; if not, the user can register as a new patient with the current time recorded. 
The database() function creates a GUI window for entering additional patient details, including gender, date of birth, symptoms, and potential COVID-19 symptoms.
Based on the input, the script provides feedback on whether the patient should get tested for COVID-19 before their appointment. 
The program is designed to be interactive and ensures that the user can submit their data or start a new form through the GUI.
