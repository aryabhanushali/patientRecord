This project is a Python-based hospital intake and screening system that combines file handling, GUI design, and basic health screening logic. It uses the Tkinter library to create an interactive graphical user interface where patients can input personal information, describe symptoms, and check off any COVID-19-related conditions they may be experiencing. The program begins by reading from a text file (patientsScheduled.txt) to display the list of pre-scheduled appointments. A Python dictionary stores scheduled patients and their appointment times, and the user is prompted to either confirm an existing appointment or register as a new patient. If a new patient registers, their name and the current timestamp are added to the system using Pythonâ€™s built-in ctime() from the time module. The form collects details such as name, gender, date of birth, and a short description of symptoms. It also includes a dynamic checklist of common COVID-19 symptoms. The backend logic uses input validation and conditional statements to evaluate the number of symptoms selected; patients showing more than three symptoms are advised to get tested before their appointment. Additionally, the program uses modular function design to manage the intake process and leverages interactive widgets like checkboxes, entry fields, buttons, and labels to create a user-friendly experience.
